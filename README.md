# HCI_data_processing
This is collection of Python, bash and ImajeJ macro scripts to analyze morphology of human T cell at single cell level. Raw data represents 16-bit multichannel fluorescent confocal images of fixed and stained T cells.

Scripts consequently process raw image data and pass for segmentation and initial extraction of morphological features to CellProfiler using bash scripts.

Final analysis of datasets representing morphological features form single cell datasets is handled via Python.
